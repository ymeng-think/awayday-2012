 * MHNibTableViewCell is a UITableViewCell subclass that makes it easy to load
 * table view cells from nib files.
 *
 * To use this class:
 *
 * 1) Create a subclass of MHNibTableViewCell. Add IBOutlets for any subviews
 * that you want to reference from the code. Also add any IBActions that you
 * want the cell itself to handle.
 *
 * 2) Create an empty NIB and add a single Table View Cell. You do not have to
 * set its cell identifier; the name of your subclass will be used for this.
 * You do have to set the cell's class to the name of your subclass.
 *
 * 3) Design the user interface and connect any outlets. If you wish to set a
 * custom background view or accessory view on the cell, then add these as
 * separate UIView objects to the root of the nib and connect them to the
 * cell's outlets. Do not add these items as subviews of the cell!
 *
 * 4) If you want your view controller to handle any IBActions, then set it as
 * the File's Owner and connect the actions.
 *
 * 5) In your data source, instantiate the cell using +cellForTable:withOwner:.
 * If you set File's Owner in the nib, then don't forget to pass the view
 * controller along in the "owner" parameter.
